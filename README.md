### Needed Installments
* Registration -- user accounts must have their passwords hashed; must prevent
  having duplicate usernames and emails registered
* Search bar -- auto-complete users to search for and load their locations (use
  POST requests)
* Generate paths between each destination sorted by time
* Install web security features e.g. Prevent SQL injections on sign in forms
* Install user settings -- Change passwords and be able to delete account
* Host the project on domain travelsharego.com
* Install profile pictures
* Tools -- (1) insert map coordinates, (2) display time span, (3) show paths
  sorted by time
* Pop-ups in map -- they should display time and render photos/blog
* Cancel user searched -- their username should appear at the top-left corner of
  the map
* Nice to have: attempt implementing the spam email in server.js
